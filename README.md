# DeepDriving
Using Computer Techniques and Neural Networks to Drive through Lanes
This project is meant to try to incorporate Electrical Engineering(EE) Principles and Artifical Intelligence all 
in one project. I am from a background leaning heavily towards EE principles and I am attempting to learn
and contribute to continuing research of autonomous driving.
